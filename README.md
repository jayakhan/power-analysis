# Test Power Analysis Code

## Overview

This repository contains code for performing power analysis to estimate the minimal detectable lift in AB testing scenarios. The power analysis helps determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a certain size with a given level of statistical power and significance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayakhan/power-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd power-analysis
   ```


### Usage

1. **Run the Power Analysis Script:**

   To perform power analysis, execute the script using Google Colab and update second block with baseline conversion and daily samples data.

2. **View Results:**

   The script will output the required sample size and generate a graph illustrating the minimal detectable lift over time.
